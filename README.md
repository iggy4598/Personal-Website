##Description
Welcome to my website! This website uses a code variation from HTML to CSS to JavaScript. In this, you will find information about myself and my hobbies!
## Home
The first three words are the stages of work that I have been through. with a small quote!
## About
This is how you will get to know me a little better. My interests and things that I like.
## portfolio
I do not have a big portfolio so I used a little magic trick that my instructor has taught me "lorem"! it just creates words at random.
