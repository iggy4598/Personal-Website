    <h1>Cars</h1>
    <p>GR86 is the car that i currently own and i love it to death. Wanting to get a porsche! Also part of Jeep Gang!</p>
    <h1>Guns</h1>
    <p>I have shot an M4 which is nice. I was a master in my own craft when it came to the m240B. The .50(M2A1) Cal is heavy to hike with but fun to shoot. The Mk19 is boring to shoot but some what fun because you can watch the round leave the barrel. The m249 jams a lot if it is not taken care of! The AT4 is a rocket and has zero recoil, do not anticipate recoil because you will miss. M203 is trash but helpful because you get a mini grenade launcher on your m4. mk18 is just an m4 but with a shorter barrel. I want it.</p>
